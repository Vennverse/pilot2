- Focused on the user's perspective, not technical features

  - **Features:** "Why is it amazing?"
  - **How It Works:** "How does it work?"

### Visual Changes
- 🎨 More vibrant, modern design
- 📐 Grid-based layouts instead of staggered
- 🌈 Gradient colors for each step
- ✨ Better use of white space
- 🔗 Clear visual connections between elements

### Message Consistency
Every element reinforces: **"Just Ask. AI Builds. You Automate."**
- No mentions of "natural language processing"
- No technical jargon
- No complexity hints
- Only simplicity and capability
